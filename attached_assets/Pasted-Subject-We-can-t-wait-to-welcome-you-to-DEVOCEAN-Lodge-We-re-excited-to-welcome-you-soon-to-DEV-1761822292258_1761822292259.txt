Subject: We can’t wait to welcome you to DEVOCEAN Lodge 🌴

We’re excited to welcome you soon to DEVOCEAN Lodge in beautiful Ponta do Ouro!

Your stay is just around the corner, and we’re here to make it smooth, comfortable, and truly memorable.
If there’s anything you’d like us to prepare ahead of your arrival, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Sean, your host, will be available throughout your stay.
He’s a treasure chest of local stories and insights — from daily village life to hidden gems, local markets, and unforgettable excursions.
Don’t be shy to ask; you might just walk away with a great story or two!

Around the lodge, you might meet a cheerful young boy — that’s Lennon, Sean’s son.
He’s proud of his bunnies and often offers guests a little farm tour.
What started as a small COVID-era project has blossomed into a mini-farm with rabbits and chickens, supporting food security for guests and staff alike.
Lisa, Lennon’s mom, also offers wonderfully relaxing massages — highly recommended!

Our kitchen is led by Raquel, who serves:

🍳 Breakfast: 7:00 – 11:00 AM

🍽️ Dinner: 5:00 – 9:00 PM (except Tuesdays — her well-deserved day off)

Sidinia, Deolinda, and Ivanilda keep the lodge and your room spotless and cozy.
Two of them are always on-site, and one starts early to prepare breakfast on request.

You may also meet Zeka (José) and Silvano, who handle maintenance around the property,
and Luis and Beqi, who are currently working on new construction projects.
