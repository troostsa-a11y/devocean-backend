Created translation helper file (8 seconds)
Now I'll create a comprehensive translation helper file for the experience detail page. Let me create a new file to handle all the UI text translations:


Created WebsiteProject/src/i18n/experienceTranslations.js

Decided on translation helper usage
Excellent! Task 2 is complete. Now let me move to task 3 - updating the ExperienceDetailPage.jsx to use these translation helpers.


Decided on translation text replacement
Now I'll update the ExperienceDetailPage.jsx to use the translation helpers. Let me start by adding the import and then replacing all hardcoded English text:

Decided on review and architect call (4 seconds)
Perfect! Task 3 is complete. All the experience detail page UI text is now using translation helpers. Let me mark it as completed and then call the architect to review all my translation work:


Decided on translation review
Let me check the logs to make sure there are no errors from my translation changes:

Checked console and system logs

Reviewed translation changes (5 seconds)
The logs show only harmless development environment warnings (Vite WebSocket connections, Microsoft Clarity dev mode, Meta pixel settings). The server is running successfully with no errors related to my translation changes.

Now let me call the architect to review all my translation work:


Reviewed translation implementation

Decided on task completion status
Excellent! The architect review passed. Now let me update the task list to mark all completed tasks:


Agent ran into an error

Removed task 4 from list

Completed tasks
Optimized Agent memory

Decided on next steps after review (5 seconds)
Perfect! I've successfully completed the translation implementation for the experience detail pages and inquiry form. Here's what was accomplished:

✅ Completed Translation Work
1. Inquiry Form Translations (ExperienceInquiryForm.jsx)
Extended all form translations to support the complete set of 17 languages:

Form labels (name, email, phone, message, preferred operator)
Input placeholders
Submit button states (default, loading, success, error)
Status messages (success, error)
reCAPTCHA privacy notice
2. Experience Page Translation Helper (experienceTranslations.js)
Created a comprehensive translation module with support for all page UI elements across 17 languages:

Page headers (Highlights, What's Included, Pricing Guide, etc.)
Sidebar sections (Duration, Level, Best Time to Visit, etc.)
Call-to-action buttons (Contact Operators, WhatsApp Us, Email Us)
Form section headers
Safety, tips, and informational sections
Template interpolation support (e.g., "Ready to Book Your {title} Adventure?")
3. ExperienceDetailPage.jsx Updates
Replaced all hardcoded English UI text with translation helper calls:

All section headings now use getExpText()
Sidebar pricing, duration, and operator sections translated
CTA buttons and links translated
Inquiry form section headers translated
Conditional text for dolphins vs. general experiences properly handled
🎯 Architect Review: PASSED
The architect confirmed:

✅ All translation keys consistently named and properly structured
✅ Complete 17-language support with English fallbacks
✅ No residual hardcoded English in UI elements
✅ Template parameter replacement working correctly
✅ Security: No issues observed
📋 Next Steps (Architect's Recommendations)
QA Spot-Check: Test a few languages on the running site to confirm rendering
Content Translation: Coordinate with content team to translate dynamic content in experienceDetails.js (titles, descriptions, pricing details, etc.)
Unit Tests: Add tests for translation helpers to protect against regressions
The translation infrastructure is now complete and ready for testing. All UI text on the experience detail pages will automatically display in the visitor's selected language (with English fallback). Dynamic content from experienceDetails.js will need separate translation when ready.

Note: Changes are complete and ready for your review. Per your preference, I have NOT built or deployed - awaiting your explicit "build and deploy" command.
