The issue you're describing—where users cannot scroll to the top of the first text block, causing the first two quick links to be non-functional—is likely related to the sticky header (<header class="sticky-header">) obstructing the scroll position or anchor links not accounting for the header's fixed height. This is a common problem with sticky headers when using anchor links (e.g., #who and #collect), as the header covers part of the target section when the browser scrolls to it.Here’s a step-by-step analysis and a suggested fix:Problem AnalysisSticky Header Issue: The <header class="sticky-header"> is likely set to position: sticky or position: fixed in the CSS (/legal/legal.fixed.css). When an anchor link (e.g., #who) is clicked, the browser scrolls to the top of the target section, but the sticky header overlaps the content, making it seem like the scroll is not reaching the intended position.
Quick Links Not Working: The first two quick links (likely pointing to #who and #collect) may appear broken because the sections are partially or fully obscured by the sticky header, or the scroll position is miscalculated.
Scroll Behavior: If the page starts with the content pushed down due to the header's height, or if JavaScript is manipulating the scroll position, it could prevent scrolling to the very top.

Suggested FixTo resolve this, you need to ensure that anchor links account for the sticky header's height when scrolling and that the page can scroll to the top without obstruction. Below are two approaches to fix this issue:Approach 1: CSS-Only Fix with Padding and Scroll-MarginAdd padding or a scroll margin to account for the sticky header's height when anchor links are targeted.Determine the Sticky Header Height:
Check the height of the <header class="sticky-header"> in your CSS (/legal/legal.fixed.css). For example, if the header is 80px tall, you can add a scroll-margin-top to all anchor target sections to offset the scroll position.
Modify the CSS:
Add the following CSS to /legal/legal.fixed.css:css

/* Ensure sections with IDs have an offset for the sticky header */
[id] {
    scroll-margin-top: 80px; /* Adjust this value to match the header height */
}

/* Optional: Ensure the main content has enough top padding to avoid overlap */
main {
    padding-top: 80px; /* Adjust this value to match the header height */
}

Replace 80px with the actual height of your sticky header. You can inspect the header's height using browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
The scroll-margin-top property adjusts the scroll position for anchor links, so the target section appears below the sticky header.
The padding-top on the <main> element ensures the first section (#who) is not obscured when the page loads.
Why This Works:scroll-margin-top offsets the scroll position for anchor links, ensuring the target section is not covered by the sticky header.
Adding padding-top to the <main> element ensures the content starts below the header, allowing users to scroll to the top of the first section.
Approach 2: JavaScript Fix for Anchor Link ScrollingIf the CSS fix doesn’t fully resolve the issue (e.g., due to dynamic header heights or JavaScript-based navigation), you can modify the anchor link behavior using JavaScript to account for the header height.Update the JavaScript:
The quick links are likely populated dynamically in /legal/legal.fixed.js or /legal/legal-i18n.js. Add a script to handle anchor link clicks and adjust the scroll position.Add the following JavaScript to /legal/legal.fixed.js:javascript

// Function to handle anchor link clicks and adjust for sticky header
function handleAnchorLink(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default anchor behavior
    const targetId = event.currentTarget.getAttribute('href').substring(1); // Get the target ID (e.g., 'who')
    const targetElement = document.getElementById(targetId);
    if (targetElement) {
        const header = document.querySelector('.sticky-header');
        const headerHeight = header ? header.offsetHeight : 0; // Get header height
        const targetPosition = targetElement.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset - headerHeight;
        window.scrollTo({
            top: targetPosition,
            behavior: 'smooth' // Smooth scrolling
        });
        // Set focus for accessibility
        targetElement.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1');
        targetElement.focus();
    }
}

// Attach event listeners to quick links
document.querySelectorAll('.quick-nav-links a, .mobile-quick-nav a').forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', handleAnchorLink);
});
Update the HTML:
Ensure the quick links in the <nav class="quick-nav"> and <div id="mobile-nav"> have proper href attributes pointing to the section IDs (e.g., href="#who"). The JavaScript above assumes these links are dynamically populated with correct href values.
Why This Works:The script intercepts clicks on anchor links, calculates the target section's position, and offsets it by the header's height.
It uses window.scrollTo with smooth scrolling for a better user experience.
It maintains accessibility by setting focus on the target section.
Additional ConsiderationsVerify Header Styling: Check /legal/legal.fixed.css to confirm the .sticky-header class uses position: sticky or position: fixed. If it’s fixed, ensure it’s not inadvertently blocking scroll events.
Test Mobile Behavior: Since you have a mobile menu (<div id="mobile-nav">), test the quick links on mobile devices to ensure the JavaScript or CSS fix works across all screen sizes.
Check for JavaScript Conflicts: The issue might be caused by existing JavaScript in /legal/legal.fixed.js or /legal/legal-i18n.js. Inspect the copySectionLink function or other scroll-related scripts to ensure they’re not interfering with anchor navigation.
Accessibility: Ensure the skip-link (<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">) works correctly and isn’t affected by the sticky header. Test it with a screen reader to confirm.

Recommended StepsStart with the CSS Fix: Apply the scroll-margin-top and padding-top changes to /legal/legal.fixed.css. This is simpler and doesn’t require modifying JavaScript.
Test the Fix:Clear the cache (<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" /> already helps with this).
Test the quick links for #who and #collect on desktop and mobile.
Verify that you can scroll to the top of the first section (#who).
Fallback to JavaScript: If the CSS fix doesn’t fully resolve the issue, implement the JavaScript solution in /legal/legal.fixed.js.
Inspect Other Pages: Since you mentioned "legal pages" (plural), apply the same fix to other legal pages (e.g., Terms of Service) if they share the same structure.

If the Issue PersistsIf neither fix works, the problem might be related to:Dynamic Content Loading: The /legal/legal-i18n.js script might be populating content after the page loads, affecting scroll behavior. Check if it manipulates the DOM in a way that interferes with scrolling.
CSS Conflicts: Inspect /legal/legal.fixed.css for any overflow: hidden or position properties on parent elements that might restrict scrolling.
Browser-Specific Issues: Test in multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to rule out browser-specific bugs.

Please test the CSS fix first and let me know if it resolves the issue or if you need help implementing the JavaScript solution. If you can share the relevant CSS from /legal/legal.fixed.css or describe any error messages, I can refine the solution further.
