Let’s lock this down with two things:

ready-to-use HTML files that point to the patched assets

a short, practical checklist to catch any remaining causes

1) Drop-in pages (wired to the fixed assets)

Use these as your canonical versions; they reference assets/legal.fixed.css + assets/legal.fixed.js.

Privacy → privacy.legal.deploy.html

Cookies → cookies.legal.deploy.html

Terms → terms.legal.deploy.html

GDPR → gdpr.legal.deploy.html

CRIC → cric.legal.deploy.html

And the patched shared assets (from earlier):

CSS → assets/legal.fixed.css

JS → assets/legal.fixed.js

Place the two files in your site under /assets/ and upload the five HTMLs.

2) Quick “it still misbehaves” checklist

If anything still looks off after swapping in the deploy files + fixed assets:

Confirm the asset paths resolve:

Open DevTools → Network → reload. You should see assets/legal.fixed.css and assets/legal.fixed.js 200-OK.

Ensure no other CSS sets html { scroll-behavior: smooth; } (search your global CSS). We removed it from the shared bundle so JS can control the exact offset.

Check the CSS var on first paint: in Console run
getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--header-height') — it should be > 0px after load. If it’s 0px, there’s likely a different header selector; make sure the header has the class .sticky-header.

Verify one sticky header only. Duplicate fixed headers or extra top banners will throw off the offset.

Inspect the first section’s top padding (in Elements): the element immediately following the sticky header should have a padding-top: calc(var(--header-height) + 20px).

If landing on a deep hash URL (e.g., /privacy.html#rights), the JS performs a one-time instant correction; make sure no external script later auto-scrolls.

If you want, I can also:

inline a super-small early script tag before your other scripts that sets --header-height even sooner (usually not necessary now), or

scan your layout CSS for any remaining scroll-behavior:smooth or global overflow that could block the top scroll.

Tell me where you’re deploying (path prefix for /assets/), and I’ll re-point all five HTML files accordingly so you can just upload and go.
